# madu-cyber-labs
Practical cybersecurity learning repository focused on offensive foundations, defensive thinking, and long-term specialization in Threat Intelligence and Cloud Security.

##Objective

Build a strong technical foundation in cybersecurity through structured, hands-on practice and public documentation.

2026 Goal:

- Develop solid skills in enumeration, web vulnerabilities, scripting, and detection logic
- Publish structured writeups
- Build reusable scripts
- Create at least one professional-style security report

##Focus Areas (Roadmap 2026)

- Linux & Networking Fundamentals
- Enumeration & Nmap Deep Practice
- Web Security (XSS, SQLi – PortSwigger)
- Automation with Python
- Detection Engineering Basics (SOC perspective)
- Cloud Security Fundamentals (IAM, S3, permissions)

This repository documents the transition from foundational knowledge to applied technical depth.

writeups/
Structured documentation of labs and exercises.

scripts/
Custom tools and automation scripts (e.g., Nmap output parsing, recon helpers).

detections/
SOC-oriented notes: detection ideas, pseudo-rules, MITRE ATT&CK mappings.

outputs/
Scan outputs and processed results.

portfolio/
Professional-style reports and consolidated projects.

##Writeup Template

Each lab follows a structured documentation format:

Objective
Tools Used
Steps & Commands
Evidence
Technical Explanation
Impact / Risk
Mitigation
Lessons Learned

The goal is not just exploitation, but understanding why it works and how it would be detected.

##Methodology Philosophy

Every offensive action must answer:

| How would this be detected from a SOC perspective?

- This repository combines:
- Offensive enumeration
- Log-based detection thinking
- Clear documentation
- Incremental technical growth

##Current Progress

Foundation phase completed:

- Linux basics
- Initial Bandit levels
- Basic Nmap usage
- Introductory web security labs
- First automation scripts

Now moving into structured enumeration, detection mapping, and deeper technical documentation.

##Metrics for Success (2026)
- 10+ structured writeups
- 3+ functional automation scripts
- 1 professional multi-phase security report
- Documented detection logic for common attack patterns

##Long-Term Direction

Target specialization:

- Threat Intelligence
- Cloud Security
- Advanced Detection Engineering

This lab serves as a public record of technical evolution.
