Linux Permissions Training 

Today was one of *those* days.

I opened the terminal and was greeted with a **“catastrophic error.”**
For a moment, I genuinely thought I had broken everything.
Somehow (and with a bit of panic), I managed to fix it and keep going.

After surviving that scare, I decided to actually **train Linux properly** instead of just skimming over things.

What I practiced today

- Setting up a training workspace in Ubuntu
- Creating directories and files
- Using `ls -la` to understand permissions
- Practicing `chmod` with:
  - Symbolic mode (`rwx`)
  - Numeric mode (`700`, `755`, `600`)
- Understanding the difference between:
  - Owner
  - Group
  - Others

At first, permissions were confusing.
But once I understood the **numeric system**, everything clicked.
Honestly, I find numbers much easier than letters.

Why this matters

Today wasn’t about being perfect.
It was about:
- Breaking things
- Fixing them
- And learning how Linux actually works under the hood

Small steps, real progress.
