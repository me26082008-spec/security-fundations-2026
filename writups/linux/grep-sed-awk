Linux Text Processing Lab

This repository documents my hands-on learning process with classic Linux
text-processing tools: grep, sed, and awk.

Instead of focusing on theory only, this lab explores how these tools are
actually used to analyze and manipulate text files — especially logs —
through practical examples.

What this project is about

Linux systems generate a massive amount of text data (logs, configs, outputs).
Opening these files manually is inefficient and often impossible at scale.

This project demonstrates how command-line tools can be used to:
- search for patterns
- filter relevant information
- transform text
- extract structured data from logs

Tools covered

grep
Used to search and filter lines based on patterns.
Examples include:
- searching for errors
- counting occurrences
- ignoring case sensitivity
- displaying line numbers

sed
Used to modify text streams.
Examples include:
- replacing words
- global substitutions
- transforming error messages

awk
Used for structured text processing.
Examples include:
- extracting specific fields
- filtering lines based on conditions
- printing formatted output
- working with line numbers
