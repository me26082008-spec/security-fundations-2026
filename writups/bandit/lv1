Bandit — Level 0 → Level 1

What I Did
This was my first time using WSL (Ubuntu).  
I created my username and password (the password not showing confused me a bit).  
I connected to the Bandit Level 0 challenge and looked around the system.

What I Learned
- Linux doesn’t show the password when typing.
- Basic navigation with `ls` and `cat`.
- How to read a simple file to get the next password.

Notes
Honestly, everything still feels new, but I'm getting used to the terminal step by step.
